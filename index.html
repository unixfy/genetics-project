									<p>This discussion, known as "Nature vs Nurture", has studies dating back to 1979 that have found evidence of a link between heredity and personality. In other words, a relationship between heredity and personality means personality can be passed down from parent to child (as we learned that genes are passed through reproduction), and possibly even modified in the future with gene-editing technology.</p>

						<div class="tab-pane" id="mn">
              <div class="card bg-primary">
                <div class="card-body">
                  <p>Beginning in 1979, a study took place in the US state of Minnesota, in which around 350 pairs of twins endured six days of intense testing of blood, brain waves, intelligence, and allergies. This was the first large-scale study of the relationship between genetics and personality.
                    <br />
                    At the time, most people believed that genetics had little to no influence on a person's personality. However, this study had some groundbreaking findings, including:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        For most traits, over half of variation in data was attributed to genetics, not environment.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The influence of environment was not nearly as strong as previously thought. For example, a family could make their naturally timid child more timid or less timid, but could never make them brave.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The traits most strongly determined by heredity were leadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well being, neuroticism, and fearlessness.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The traits least strongly determined by heredity included the need for personal intimacy.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Each trait is influenced by <i>multiple</i> genes, but the study was unable to determine which ones.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    The evidence from this study strongly served to both educate parents about how to best raise their children, but also seriously change the social norm that personality was solely based on a person's environment.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>

                    In 2016, another study regarding genetics & personality took place in Norway. 2136 twins were sent a voluntary survey, to which 71% responded. The survey contained a life satisfaction and personality test. The study found that about 30-40% of personality traits were related to heredity (especially neuroticism and extroversion), and that life satisfaction is also related to genetics. However, it also found that even without the most "ideal" genetics regarding life satisfaction, environmental conditions can result in a very high satisfaction with one's life.

                        Researchers in San Diego, CA, US, using data from DNA testing services like 23andme, were able to link extraversion to the genes <code>WSCD2</code> and <code>PCDH15</code>. In addition, they linked neuroticism to the gene <code>L3MBTL2</code> and chromosome <code>8p23.1</code>.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Researchers at Stanford University in Stanford, CA, US found that depression was caused half the time by genes, and the other half by environment.
                      </li>

                    Based on the data in the aforementioned studies, it is possible to conclude that <b>while genes and personality do have a relationship, it is not possible to conclusively attribute all of one's personality traits to their genes.</b>
